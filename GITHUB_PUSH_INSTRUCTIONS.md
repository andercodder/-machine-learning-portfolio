## Step 3: Run These Commands (30 seconds)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /home/andre/portfolio/machine-learning-portfolio-clean

# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/andercodder/machine-learning-portfolio.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: You may be asked for GitHub credentials:

Machine Learning Portfolio
https://github.com/andercodder/machine-learning-portfolio

â€¢ XGBoost/LightGBM for situation awareness prediction
â€¢ RNN time-series models for EV battery health forecasting
â€¢ Deep Q-Network for sequential optimization
â€¢ Content-based recommendation system
```

### 2. Update LinkedIn
- Add to "Featured" section
- Link: https://github.com/andercodder/machine-learning-portfolio
- Description: "Machine Learning portfolio showcasing XGBoost, time-series forecasting, deep learning, and reinforcement learning projects"

### 3. Apply to TotalEnergies
- Use cover letter template in `TOTALENERGIES_REFERENCE.md`
- Include portfolio link in cover letter
- Mention: XGBoost, time-series, energy sector experience

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Generate new token with "repo" scope
- Use token as password

### Issue: "Repository already exists"
**Solution**: Either:
- Delete the existing repo on GitHub and recreate
- Or use a different name like `ml-portfolio` or `machine-learning-projects`

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the correct GitHub account (andercodder)
