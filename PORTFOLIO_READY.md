```
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software 
Development Internship at TotalEnergies. As a current MSc student in Machine 
Learning & AI at the University of Aberdeen, I have developed expertise in 
gradient boosting, time-series forecasting, and production ML systems—skills 
directly aligned with your AutoML forecasting initiatives.

My portfolio demonstrates hands-on experience with your key requirements:

• XGBoost & LightGBM: Implemented both algorithms for situation awareness 
  prediction, achieving strong performance through systematic hyperparameter 
  optimization (Project 1)

• Time-Series Forecasting: Developed RNN-based models for EV battery health 
  prediction, demonstrating temporal modeling capabilities critical for energy 
  trading applications (Project 2)

• Energy Sector: Applied ML to energy systems optimization, directly relevant 
  to your Carbon Neutrality 2050 goal

• Software Engineering: Built modular, production-ready pipelines with 
  comprehensive documentation across all projects

Portfolio: https://github.com/andercodder/-machine-learning-portfolio

I am particularly excited about contributing to TotalEnergies' innovative ML 
solutions for energy trading. My combination of theoretical knowledge, 
practical implementation skills, and passion for energy sector applications 
makes me well-suited for this role.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute 
to your team's AutoML initiatives.

Best regards,
Andre de Carvalho
