# Notebook Status

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: GitHub was showing "Unable to render code block" error  
**Cause**: Aggressive notebook cleaning removed too much metadata  
**Solution**: Restored original notebooks with full outputs and metadata

## 📓 Current Notebook Status

All notebooks are now in their **original format** with:
- ✅ Full outputs preserved (shows your results!)
- ✅ All metadata intact
